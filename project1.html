					<h2 class="problem">The problem:</h2>
					<p>Let's say we want to spend some free time on the computer. We want to watch a movie/series episode, a couple videos or maybe some livestreams, but we don't know what exactly we want  to see.
						We have to check every app/site we like to spend time on to see what's new, what's happening. This is time-consuming. It would be great to have all of the new content shown in one place  
						where we can quickly check everything and decide, then go to the desired application or website.
					</p>
					<h2 class="idea">The idea:</h2>
					<p>
						We want to design an app that lists wha a user can do in their free time, if they want to spend it watching something online.
					</p>
					<h2>Possible drawbacks:</h2>
					<p>
						We need to connect different accounts with his app. This means that we have to contact other companies and ask for permission. Also, accessing user data through API's is going to be 
						a very difficult development task.
					</p>

					<hr>

					<h2>Who is the app aimed at?</h2>
					<p>
						People, who spend a lot of free time on the internet. Users, who consume mainly digital content in the form of livestreams, videos, series, movies and video games. People, who are 
						registered on multiple sites that provide the aforementioned content and thus need to see what is happening on those platforms.
					</p>

					<h2>User personas:</h2>
					<h3>Persona #1:</h3>
					<p>
						Name: Bill
						<br>
						Age: 16
						<br>
						Occupation: Student
						<br>
						About: Comes from a middle-class family. Father is a lawyer, mother is a teacher. He is currently in middle school, focusing on maths and physics. Has a game console, 
						which he uses to play games and watch streams, and a laptop to message friends & family and do homework. Bill has around 3-4 hours of free time a day and he typically 
						uses it to play video games and watch videos. He has an affinity for technology. During school breaks, he has a lot of free time on his hands.
					</p>
					<h4>What he likes:</h4>
					<p>
						Clear, obvious instructions
						<br>
						Pragmatism
						<br>
						Fairness
					</p>
					<h4>What he doesn't like:</h4>
					<p>
						Wasting time
						<br>
						Being misled
						<br>
						Inaccuracy
					</p>

					<h3>Persona #2:</h3>
					<p>
						Name: Martha
						<br>
						Age: 39
						<br>
						Occupation: Animator
						<br>
						About: Martha is a senior animator and has been working as one for 15 years. She loves it and is not planning on changing careers. She is very serious when it comes to work, 
						very conscious about attention to detail, but in her private life, she is very relaxed and easy-going. When it comes to her day, she likes to have it defined – there’s a time for work, 
						training, and private life. In her free time, she wants to have fun and relax – nothing serious. She is very straightforward as well.
					</p>
					<h4>What she likes:</h4>
					<p>
						Precision
						<br>
						Clarity
						<br>
						(Trying out) new things
					</p>
					<h4>What she doesn't like:</h4>
					<p>
						Beating around the bush
						<br>
						When something doesn't  work
					</p>

					<h3>Persona #3:</h3>
					<p>
						Name: Samantha
						<br>
						Age: 24
						<br>
						Occupation: Secretary trainee
						<br>
						About: Samantha is not a tech-savvy person. She deals with what she has to at work and then at home, she watches the occasional video about various topics, 
						like cooking or lifestyle. Even though, as a secretary, she has to work with timetables, she is all over the place herself. Sometimes she forgets something at home. 
						Sometimes she is oblivious of what she wanted to do. 
					</p>
					<h4>What she likes:</h4>
					<p>
						Simplicity
						<br>
						Guidance
					</p>
					<h4>What she doesn't like:</h4>
					<p>
						Assumptions
						<br>
						Being overwhelmed
						<br>
						Being pressured into something
					</p>

					<h2>Main requirements & features</h2>
					<p>
						In order to be able to start working on the design of the app, I needed to know what features the product was going to have, so it was time to outline them.
						<br>
						User creation and login
						<br>
						Accoung linking
						<br>
						Filtering - eg. livestreams only, series & movies only, etc.
						<br>
						Notification management; reminders
						<br>
						"Open in..." / "Go to ... app"
						<br>
						Parental control/guidance
						<br>
						Basic messaging/connect/planner feature that allows the user to do something with another user (eg. new episode of a series -> plan with user B -> “8pm tomorrow?”)
						<br>
						Personalization
						<br>
						Sync with calendar app(s)
						<br>
						I also felt like we should include a first time setup - or onboarding screen(s) - for new users. So, it was time to create a user journey chart for that.
