                <p>
                  Let's say we want to spend some free time on the computer and watch a movie/series episode,
                  a couple videos or maybe some livestreams, but we don't know what exactly we want to see.
                  We have to check every app/site we like to spend time on to see what's new, what's happening.
                  This is time-consuming.</p>

                <h2>The idea</h2>
                <p>
                  We want to design an app that lists what a user can do in their free time,
                  if they want to spend it watching something online.
                  The app will show new pieces of content from different accounts in one place and provide quick access to
                  them.

                  People, who spend a lot of free time on the internet.
                  Users, who consume mainly digital content in the form of livestreams, videos, series, movies and video
                  games.
                  People, who are registered on multiple sites that provide the aforementioned content
                  and thus need to see what is happening on those platforms.

                <h2>Possible drawbacks</h2>
                <p>
                  We need to connect different accounts with this app.
                  This means that we have to contact other companies and ask for permission.
                  Also, accessing user data through API's might be a very difficult development task.

            <p>
              In order to be able to start working on the design of the app,
              I needed to know what features the product was going to have, so it was time to outline them.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>User creation and login</li>
              <li>Account linking</li>
              <li>Filtering - eg. livestreams only, series & movies only, etc.</li>
              <li>Notification management; reminders</li>
              <li>"Open in... / Go to â€¦ app"</li>
              <li>Parental control/guidance</li>
              <li>
                Basic messaging/connect/planner feature that allows the user to do something together with another user
                (eg. watch an episode with someone)
              </li>
              <li>Personalization</li>
              <li>Sync with calendar app(s)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I also felt like we should include a first time setup - or onboarding screen(s) - for new users.
              So, it was time to create a user journey chart for that.

              Now that we have defined what the app should be,
              created personas and outlined the main features and the user journey for the onboarding part,
              we can start designing how the app should look.
              I started with low-fidelity designs: wireframes on paper.
              I started playing around with ideas: looks, layouts, etc.
              I sketched these ideas on paper and then asked some other people to vote on them.
              You can see the different ideas on the pictures below,
              and you can also see the ones that got the most votes: their letters are circled.

            <h2>High-fidelity design</h2>
            <p>
              Now that the general direction of the design of the product has been outlined,
              it was time to move on to the next phase: high-fidelity designs and prototyping.
              For this, I'd decided to use Figma. Over the next couple of days I started designing the app.
              First, the onboarding part and every screen of it.
              Then came the main main part(s) of the application: the main screen and its details.
              And lastly, the user's profile and settings.
              The reason I'd decided to go in this order was that this way,
              I felt I was more able to put myself in the position of the end user:
              design their journey and think of basics that are needed and nice to have's that are welcomed.
              During this intensive design period, when I felt like I was done with parts of the product
              (after the onboarding, the main screen & features and the user profile respectively)
              I conducted multiple usability tests.
              I shared my Figma prototype with a group of people and asked them to try to use it.
              I told them that it was a prototype that didn't contain any code
              so it wouldn't be taking into account any choices they make (eg. choosing a theme),
              but other than that, they should treat it as if it was a near-ready product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some tests were one-on-one interviews where I could get more detailed feedback
              and some were group sessions where I let the members bounce ideas off of each other.
              Based on the feedbacks I got, the designs were adjusted multiple times.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 35px">
              Instead of showing you some pictures of the finalized design here,
              I thought it'd be a good idea to show you some <b class="hl-color-purple"><i>designs that didn't make
              it</i></b>
              - to show you that, of course, not everything went smoothly.
              And, if you'd like to, you can check why these design ended up reworked or scratched completely,
              using the buttons next to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time, some features were cancelled as well, like the connections and planning features,
              that would've allowed users to add other users and plan watching something with them.
              Other features have been added that weren't among the initial ones, like the ability to report a bug or
              log
              out.
              The product's visual customization by the user was also toned down,
              in order to keep the signature color scheme and general feel of the app.
