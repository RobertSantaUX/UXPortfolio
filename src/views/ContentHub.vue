              In order to be able to start working on the design of the app, I
              needed to know what features the product was going to have, so it
              was time to outline them.

              <li>User creation and login</li>
              <li>Account linking</li>
              <li>
                Filtering - eg. livestreams only, series & movies only, etc.
              </li>
              <li>Notification management; reminders</li>
              <li>"Open in... / Go to â€¦ app"</li>
              <li>Parental control/guidance</li>
              <li>
                Basic messaging/connect/planner feature that allows the user to
                do something together with another user (eg. watch an episode
                with someone)
              </li>
              <li>Personalization</li>

              I also felt like we should include a first time setup - or
              onboarding screen(s) - for new users. So, it was time to create a
              user journey chart for that.

              Now that we have defined what the app should be, created personas
              and outlined the main features and the user journey for the
              onboarding part, we can start designing how the app should look. I
              started with low-fidelity designs: wireframes on paper. I started
              playing around with ideas: looks, layouts, etc. I sketched these
              ideas on paper and then asked some other people to vote on them.
              You can see the different ideas on the pictures below, and you can
              also see the ones that got the most votes: their letters are
              circled.

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 hl-color-purple">High-fidelity design</h2>
            <p>
              Now that the general direction of the design of the product has
              been outlined, it was time to move on to the next phase:
              high-fidelity designs and prototyping. For this, I'd decided to
              use Figma. Over the next couple of days I started designing the
              app. First, the onboarding part and every screen of it. Then came
              the main main part(s) of the application: the main screen and its
              details. And lastly, the user's profile and settings. The reason
              I'd decided to go in this order was that this way, I felt I was
              more able to put myself in the position of the end user: design
              their journey and think of basics that are needed and nice to
              have's that are welcomed. During this intensive design period,
              when I felt like I was done with parts of the product (after the
              onboarding, the main screen & features and the user profile
              respectively) I conducted multiple usability tests. I shared my
              Figma prototype with a group of people and asked them to try to
              use it. I told them that it was a prototype that didn't contain
              any code so it wouldn't be taking into account any choices they
              make (eg. choosing a theme), but other than that, they should
              treat it as if it was a near-ready product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some tests were one-on-one interviews where I could get more
              detailed feedback and some were group sessions where I let the
              members bounce ideas off of each other. Based on the feedbacks I
              got, the designs were adjusted multiple times.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 35px">
              Instead of showing you some pictures of the finalized design here,
              I thought it'd be a good idea to show you some
              <b class="hl-color-purple"><i>designs that didn't make it</i></b>
              - to show you that, of course, not everything went smoothly. And,
              if you'd like to, you can check why these design ended up reworked
              or scratched completely, using the buttons next to them.

                    We are the designers of the app, we should come up with a good design and feel that the user is comfortable with. Giving the user excessive customizability could hurt visibility as well.

              During this time, some features were cancelled as well, like the
              connections and planning features, that would've allowed users to
              add other users and plan watching something with them. Other
              features have been added that weren't among the initial ones, like
              the ability to report a bug or log out. The product's visual
              customization by the user was also toned down, in order to keep
              the signature color scheme and general feel of the app.
